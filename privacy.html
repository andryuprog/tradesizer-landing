    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective as of: August 1, 2025</p>

    <p>We respect your privacy. This policy explains how data is handled within our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The app collects limited, non-personally identifiable technical data to improve stability and user experience. This includes crash reports and anonymous usage statistics.</p>

    <h2>Analytics & Crash Reporting</h2>
    <p>We use third-party services provided by Google Firebase, including Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Analytics. These services collect and analyze anonymized data about app usage, technical performance, and crashes. This helps us identify bugs and improve the application's reliability and functionality.</p>

    <p>No personal data such as names, emails, or contacts is collected.</p>

    <h2>Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app does not request access to contacts, location, camera, microphone, or any sensitive device features.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>You can learn more about how Google uses collected data by visiting: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>

    <h2>User Choice</h2>
    <p>You may disable analytics collection at any time in the app settings (if implemented). Future versions may provide an explicit consent screen in accordance with applicable data protection regulations.</p>

    <h2>Future Changes</h2>
    <p>If data collection or third-party services are extended in the future, this policy will be updated accordingly. Users will have the opportunity to review the changes prior to them taking effect.</p>
