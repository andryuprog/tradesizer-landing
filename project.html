   <h1>Position and Stop-Loss Calculator</h1>
    <p>
      This project is designed for traders and investors who want to manage risks effectively in volatile markets. 
      The calculator works with <strong>ATR</strong> data and calculates <strong>NATR</strong> based on them. 
      <strong>Note:</strong> The indicators themselves are not included — the user needs to input the ATR/NATR values manually.
    </p>

    <h2>Why use this calculator?</h2>
    <p>
      Regardless of whether you trade cryptocurrencies, stocks, or other assets, one of the most important tasks for a trader is risk management. 
      Errors in calculation can lead to losses, while a correct approach helps preserve capital and maintain consistent growth.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Determine optimal position size based on market volatility.</li>
      <li>Calculate stop-loss in percentages and absolute values.</li>
      <li>"From Deposit" mode — enter your total capital and the percentage risk per trade.</li>
      <li>User-friendly interface for fast decisions without complex formulas or manual calculations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future of the project</h2>
    <p>
      If the project gains interest and support from users, we plan to develop it further. Possible directions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Desktop version release.</li>
      <li>Automatic data loading for assets to improve calculation accuracy.</li>
      <li>Trader’s mini-journal for easy tracking and analysis of trades.</li>
      <li>Additional analytics tools: market movement statistics, volatility ranges, historical data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All of these enhancements will be implemented only if the project finds an audience and support. 
      Below are examples of what could be done in the future:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Integration of asset-specific data, so the user only inputs risk per trade while ATR/NATR values are pre-filled.</li>
      <li>Adding a minimal set of fields for a trader’s journal for convenience and performance analysis.</li>
      <li>Advanced market analysis features, such as scraping websites for historical price data and calculating expected price ranges.</li>
    </ul>
